        <div className="box2-text">E-Cell IIIT NAYA RAIPUR is a non-profit student run organization where we crave and explore the constantly evolving world of entrepreneurship and start-up cult. In our quest to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship among the community, we try to answer essential questions like “How this realm of entrepreneurship affects us in our day-to-day lives?” and the likes of “Can I construct my start-up idea into a functional business model?” To spread this very essence, we host various seminars/webinars, lectures, podcasts and book summaries, innovative games, brainstorming sessions, competitions. Besides that, we host the most prominent annual entrepreneurial summit of central India, which includes numerous informative events about entrepreneurship.</div>
